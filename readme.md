# 100 Days of Coding

This is a repository where you will document your progress and challenges in learning how to code for 100 days,by following the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge, which is a self-directed initiative to commit to coding for at least an hour every day for 100 consecutive days.



## How to track  progress?

Fork this repo. Create a log file in the repository which you have cloned, where you will write a brief summary of what you did, learned, and struggled with each day. I will also post my updates on this repo in a different branch.

## What are the rules?

The rules are simple:

- Code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.
- Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
- Encourage and support at least two other people in the challenge every day.
- Be honest and don't skip days (unless you are sick or something urgent comes up).
- Have fun and enjoy the process!
